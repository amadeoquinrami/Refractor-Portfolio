<div class="bio">
    <h2><strong>Just a little about me</strong> </h2>
        <p class="first_paragraph">I am the oldest of two younger brothers. 
            Growing up as the oldest child I often fought
             with my younger siblings. I was the one that
              usually showed them how to do things. </p><br>
        <p class="second_paragraph">As I matured I realized I had to take care of
             my brothers. We began to build our bond again.
              Now it was my other brothers who went through 
              their own rough patch of fighting with each other. 
              I was now the one to mediate their fights. 
         </p><br>
        <p class="third_paragraph">Spending 18 years in a quiet  agricultural town
             in California ignited my curiosity about the world 
             beyond its borders. I am the oldest after all and 
             privileged to have been raised with progressive parents 
             that let me step outside my comfort zone. <br><br>So I decided 
             to move across the country for college to challenge myself. 
             Coming to Charlotte with no family nearby, or friends and 
             completely starting from scratch was something I knew I had 
             to do for my personal growth. My personal growth was finding 
             who I was, and coming to a new environment where knowing of me helped me a lot.  
            My second growth had come when I had challenged myself in college to be 
 involved in the American Marketing Associate club and became an Event planner. 
 This was best for my Professional development. My background of being a second generation college student is a learning process of acquiring these technical skills. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a degree in International Studies, demonstrating my ability to acquire essential skills on my own. I thrive on challenging myself and embracing discomfort, a mindset shaped by my upbringing and my adaptability in navigating new environments, enhanced by my keen observational skills.
