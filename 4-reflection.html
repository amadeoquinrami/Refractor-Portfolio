         <p class="reflection-paragraph">When I was fortunate enough to realize that I 
            was accepted to the program I made sure to mentally 
            prepare myself. When I arrived on campus we were greeted 
            and made to participate and were given the guidelines 
            for what is expected of the program. Although there 
            were some hiccups with setting everything up with our 
            computer and downloading files I never heard about, I 
            was eager to get started. The Road2hire staff made use 
            of the lines of communication in the event of  an emergency. 
            I believe Road2hire has made it possible to stay organized 
            by setting up a canvas resource to understand our assignment 
            and additional resources. I believe that the bi weekly meeting 
            with our professional Development mentor will help us fine tune 
            everything.</p>

     <div>
        <h3 class="question-text"><em>What was my experience?</em></h3>
         <p class="reflection-paragraph">The first week of Road2hire was just a preview 
            of the second week. I'm learning HTML and CSS, 
            as well as effective ways to learn. Learning the 
            basics of website creation will enhance my 
            understanding of other coding methods. Being in the service
            industry has made me gain the ability of to talk to different 
            personalityies and this will help with getting to network with 
            people.

     <div>
        <h3 class="question-text"><em>What was my experience?</em></h3>
         <p class="reflection-paragraph"> I genuinely value the Road2Hire program 
            and commend the initiative's commitment 
            to supporting individuals in their journey 
            of personal development. The canvas and 
            timelines help track upcoming assignments and 
            projects. Also being the first week of being 
            in road 2 hire has been testing out my endurance 
            on staying on task and completing assignments. 
            These assignments have truly challenged my ability 
            to prioritize effectively and to embrace the importance 
            of moving forward.
